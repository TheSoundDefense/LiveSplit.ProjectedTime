LiveSplit.ProjectedTime
=======================

This LiveSplit component displays an estimated final time for the run, given the runner's current rate of time gain/loss. The component can also display a percentage estimate of how much of the run is complete.

For example, if the runner has lost 10 seconds in the first 10% of the run, the component will project that the runner will lose 100 seconds over the entire run, and display a projected time accordingly.

**Download:** [LiveSplit.ProjectedTime.dll](https://github.com/TheSoundDefense/LiveSplit.ProjectedTime/raw/master/Components/LiveSplit.ProjectedTime.dll)

To use this component, download the above DLL file and place it in the Components folder of your LiveSplit installation. This component will appear under the **Information** category.

By default, the projected time and completion percentage are based on your current comparison and timing method. This can be adjusted in the Layout Settings.
